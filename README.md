  Design patterns in JavaFx
</h1>

## Project

 `JavaFx` Trello-like application.

 This application was developed in an academic course during my second year of the bachelor in computed science at EPFC.
 `Java` and `JavaFx` are an excuse; the true purposes of this exercise are the design patterns: MVVM, command pattern, DAO pattern, repository pattern, ... 

## Description

 Based on a organiser like Trello, this application allows the user to create and manage boards, columns and cards.
